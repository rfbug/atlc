.SH NAME
\fBcreate_bmp_for_stripline_coupler\fR - bitmap generator for coupler with thin striplines between two infinitely wide groundplanes (part of \fBatlc\fR)
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBcreate_bmp_for_stripline_coupler [-C] [-b bitmapsize] [-v] H w s Er outputfile\fR

.SH WARNING
This man page is not a complete set of documentation - the complexity of the atlc project makes man pages not an ideal way to document it, although out of completeness, man pages are produced. 
The best documentation that was current at the time the version was produced should be found on your
hard drive, usually at 
.br
/usr/local/share/atlc/docs/html\-docs/index.html 
.br
although it might be elsewhere if
your system administrator chose to install the package elsewhere. Sometimes, errors are corrected
in the documentation and placed at http://atlc.sourceforge.net/ before a new release of atlc is
released.  Please, if you notice a problem with the documentation - even spelling errors and typos,
please let me know. 

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBcreate_bmp_for_stripline_coupler\fR is a pre-processor for \fBatlc\fR, the finite difference 
program that is used to calculate the 
properties of a two and three conductor electrical transmission lines of arbitrary 
cross section. The program \fBcreate_bmp_for_stripline_coupler\fR is used as a fast way of
generating bitmaps (there is no need to use a graphics program), for a
pair of 1 pixel thick conductors of width w, spaced a distance s apart, 
inside a pair of
groundplanes of  separation H. This has an exact analytical
answer, when the inner is infinitely thin and the overall width W is infinitely
wide. This theoretical impedance is calculated and printed to stderr if 
the -v option is given on create_bmp_for_stripline_coupler's command line.

The overall width W is calculated internally to be large enough that
making it any larger will have negligible effect on the results.
The dielectric is assumed that of vacuum.
.PP 
.br
The bitmaps produced by \fBcreate_bmp_for_stripline_coupler\fR are 24-bit bit colour bitmaps, as are required by \fBatlc\fR.

.br
\fB-b bitmapsize\fR
.br
is used to set the size of the bitmap, and so the accuracy to which atlc
is able to calculate the coupler's properties. The default
value for 'bitmapsize' is normally 18 although this can be set at
compile time. (see 'DEFAULT_COUPLER_BITMAP_SIZE' in definitions.h). The value can be set anywhere from 6 to 28. The size of bitmap produced will be
between 2^(bitmapsize-1) and 2^(bitmapsize+1), so if its set to 28 the
bitmap could be as big as 512 Mb, which would take an eternity to
compute. 
.PP
\fB-v \fR
.br
Print some extra data to stdout on the theoretical impedance of the
structure. This is useful to compare with the numerical result from
\fBatlc\fR
