The file atlc.pdf is a copy of a paper I wrote describing a very early version of
this programme in QEX - an amatuer radio journal. The file ATLC.C is the C source
that accompanied that paper. ATLC.EXE is a DOS executable. 

The DOS version is no longer developed, but this is included for completeness.
