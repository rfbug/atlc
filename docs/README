The documentation falls into 3 types
1) A very old pdf file describing an early version of the code. This was
published in the amatuer radio journal QEX.
2) HTML documantation which forms the best looking format to date.
3) Man pages, which are not here, but directly off of the root (in in
atlc-x.y.z/man)
4) 3 attempts at papers theory/theory2.doc, theory/atlc9.doc and a 
Staroffice file
