<H2>NAME</H2><PRE>
     <B>readbin</B> - ATLC's binary file information provider


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
     <B>readbin</B>  <B>filename.bin</B>


</PRE>
<H2>WARNING</H2><PRE>
     This man page is not a complete set of documentation  -  the
     complexity  of the atlc project makes man pages not an ideal
     way to document it, although out of completeness, man  pages
     are produced. The best documentation that was current at the
     time this version was produced should be found on your  hard
     drive, usually at
     /usr/local/share/atlc/docs/html-docs/index.html
     although it might be elsewhere if your system  administrator
     chose  to  install  the package elsewhere. Sometimes, errors
     are  corrected  in   the   documentation   and   placed   at
     http://atlc.sourceforge.net/ before a new release of atlc is
     released.  Please, if you notice a problem with the documen-
     tation - even spelling errors and typos, please let me know.

     There are no options for readbin


</PRE>
<H2>EXAMPLE</H2><PRE>
     % readbin coax2.V.bin
     file length=127008 bytes = 15876 pixels
     there are: 489 ones, 10852 zeros, 0 -ones, 4535 other values


</PRE>
<H2>FILES</H2><PRE>
     atlc-X.Y.Z/docs/html-docs/index.html
     the full documentation. bitmapfile.bmp
        Original bitmap file. Must be 24-bit colour uncompressed.
     bitmapfile.Ex.bin
        X-component of E-field as a binary.
     bitmapfile.Ey.bin
        y-component of E-field as a binary. .
     bitmapfile.E.bin
        Sqrt(Ex^2+Ey^2), as a binary. bitmapfile.V.bin
     bitmapfile.V.bin
        Voltage as a binary.

     All the saved binary files (.bin's) are saved  as  a  double
