<H2>WARNING</H2><PRE>
     This man page is not a complete set of documentation  -  the
     complexity  of the atlc project makes man pages not an ideal
     way to document it, although out of completeness, man  pages
     are produced. The best documentation that was current at the
     time the version was produced should be found on  your  hard
     drive, usually at
     /usr/local/share/atlc/docs/html-docs/index.html
     although it might be elsewhere if your system  administrator
     chose  to  install  the package elsewhere. Sometimes, errors
     are  corrected  in   the   documentation   and   placed   at
     http://atlc.sourceforge.net/ before a new release of atlc is
     released.  Please, if you notice a problem with the documen-
     tation - even spelling errors and typos, please let me know.

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     <B>create_bmp_for_stripline_coupler</B>  is  a  pre-processor   for
     <B>atlc</B>,  the  finite difference program that is used to calcu-
     late the properties of a two and three conductor  electrical
     transmission  lines  of arbitrary cross section. The program
     <B>create_bmp_for_stripline_coupler</B> is used as a  fast  way  of
     generating  bitmaps (there is no need to use a graphics pro-
     gram), for a pair of 1 pixel thick conductors  of  width  w,
     spaced  a distance s apart, inside a pair of groundplanes of
     separation H. This has an exact analytical answer, when  the
     inner  is  infinitely thin and the overall width W is infin-
     itely wide. This theoretical  impedance  is  calculated  and
     printed   to   stderr   if   the   -v  option  is  given  on
     create_bmp_for_stripline_coupler's command line.

     The overall width W is calculated  internally  to  be  large
     enough that making it any larger will have negligible effect
     on the results.  The dielectric is assumed that of vacuum.

     The bitmaps produced by <B>create_bmp_for_stripline_coupler</B> are
     24-bit bit colour bitmaps, as are required by <B>atlc</B>.

<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
     <B>-C</B>
     Print the full copyright information and exit.

     <B>-b</B> <B>bitmapsize</B>
     is used to set the size of the bitmap, and so  the  accuracy
     to which atlc is able to calculate the coupler's properties.
     The default value for 'bitmapsize' is normally  18  although
     this     can     be    set    at    compile    time.    (see
     'DEFAULT_COUPLER_BITMAP_SIZE' in definitions.h).  The  value
     can  be  set  anywhere from 6 to 28. The size of bitmap pro-
     duced will be between 2^(bitmapsize-1) and 2^(bitmapsize+1),
     so  if  its  set to 28 the bitmap could be as big as 512 Mb,
     which would take an eternity to compute.

     <B>-v</B>
     Print some extra data to stdout on the theoretical impedance
     of the structure. This is useful to compare with the numeri-
     cal result from <B>atlc</B>
