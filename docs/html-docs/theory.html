<H1>The theory of <COde>atlc</code></H1>
The finite differnece program <CODE>atlc</CODE> is not that complex to understand, but neither is
it trivual. There are 5 places you will find information on the theory of <code>atlc</code>.
<OL>
	<LI>An article <a href="../qex-december-1996/atlc.pdf">docs/qex-december-1996/atlc.pdf</a>
	written for the amatuer radio Journal QEX back in 1996. This gives a basic introduction, but it is
	not up to date at all. <code>atlc</code> has changed a lot since 1996.</LI>
	<LI>The notes in the Word file <a href="../theory/atlc-theory1.doc">docs/theory/atlc-theory1.doc</a> This is written by me, for me and as such it is not written in a coherent way, but it might be
	of use to someone. </LI>
	<LI>The notes in the Word file <a href="../theory/atlc-theory2.doc">docs/theory/atlc-theory2.doc</a> This is written by me, for me and as such it is not written in a coherent way, but it might be
	of use to someone. DESPITE THE 2 AS A SUFFIX, THIS MIGHT BE EARLER THAN THE FILE MENTIONED
	ABOVE, I DON'T KNOW.</LI>
	<LI>The notes in the StarOffice/OpenOffice file <a href="../theory/ideas-for-gui.sxw">docs/theory/ideas-for-a-gui.sxw</a> This is just a few thoughts I had on a GUI. There is no doubt a nice GUI
	<LI>Books on finite difference and EM theory.</LI>
