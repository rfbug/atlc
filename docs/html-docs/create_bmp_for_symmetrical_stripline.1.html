<H2>WARNING</H2><PRE>
     This man page is not a complete set of documentation  -  the
     complexity  of the atlc project makes man pages not an ideal
     way to document it, although out of completeness, man  pages
     are produced. The best documentation that was current at the
     time the version was produced should be found on  your  hard
     drive, usually at
     /usr/local/share/atlc/docs/html-docs/index.html
     although it might be elsewhere if your system  administrator
     chose  to  install  the package elsewhere. Sometimes, errors
     are  corrected  in   the   documentation   and   placed   at
     http://atlc.sourceforge.net/ before a new release of atlc is
     released.  Please, if you notice a problem with the documen-
     tation - even spelling errors and typos, please let me know.

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     <B>create_bmp_for_symmetrical_stripline</B> is a pre-processor  for
     <B>atlc</B>,  the  finite difference program that is used to calcu-
     late the properties of a two-conductor electrical  transmis-
     sion   line   of   arbitrary   cross  section.  The  program
     <B>create_bmp_for_symmetrical_stripline</B> is used as a  fast  way
     of  generating  bitmaps  (there is no need to use a graphics
     program), for a 1 pixel thick conductor  of  width  w,  cen-
     trally  located inside a pair of groundplanes of width W and
     separation H. This has an exact analytical answer, when  the
     inner is infinitely thin and the width W is infinitely wide.
     This  theoretical  impedance  is  also  calculated  by   the
     create_bmp_for_symmetrical_stripline.  It  is therefore used
     as a test of atlc.

     The parameters 'W' and 'H' and the inner dimensions  of  the
     outer  conductor.  The outer dimensions of the inner conduc-
     tor are 'w' and 'c'. The inner conductor is assumed to  rest
     on  a dielectric (Er2) which is 'd' wide and outer conductor
     an the inner conductor is offset  'b'  from  the  left  hand
     sidewall  of  the  outer conductor. The whole region is sur-
     rounded by a dielectric of relative permittivity 'Er1'.  The
     dielectrics 'Er1' and then 'Er1' and 'Er2' will both be 1.0

     The bitmaps produced by <B>create_bmp_for_symmetrical_stripline</B>
     are  24-bit  bit  colour  bitmaps,  as are required by <B>atlc</B>.
     Currently create_bmp_for_symmetrical_stripline only produces
     bitmaps with white (vacuum) dielectrics.

<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
     <B>-v</B>
     Print the theoeretical impedance Zo. This only works if  the
     width  W  is sufficiently wide, otherwise atlc and the value
     printed here would disagree wildly.
