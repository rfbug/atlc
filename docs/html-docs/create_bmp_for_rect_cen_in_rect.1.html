<H2>WARNING</H2><PRE>
     This man page is not a complete set of documentation  -  the
     complexity  of the atlc project makes man pages not an ideal
     way to document it, although out of completeness, man  pages
     are produced. The best documentation that was current at the
     time the version was produced should be found on  your  hard
     drive, usually at
     /usr/local/share/atlc/docs/html-docs/index.html
     although it might be elsewhere if your system  administrator
     chose  to  install  the package elsewhere. Sometimes, errors
     are  corrected  in   the   documentation   and   placed   at
     http://atlc.sourceforge.net/ before a new release of atlc is
     released.  Please, if you notice a problem with the documen-
     tation - even spelling errors and typos, please let me know.

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     <B>create_bmp_for_rect_cen_in_rect</B> is a pre-processor for <B>atlc</B>,
     the  finite difference program that is used to calculate the
     properties of a two-conductor electrical  transmission  line
     of      arbitrary     cross     section.     The     program
     <B>create_bmp_for_rect_cen_in_rect</B> is used as  a  fast  way  of
     generating  bitmaps (there is no need to use a graphics pro-
     gram), for a rectangular conductor placed  centrally  inside
     another rectangular conductor, like this:

     The parameters 'W' and 'H' and the inner dimensions  of  the
     outer  conductor.  The outer dimensions of the inner conduc-
     tor are 'w' and 'h'. The inner conductor is  assumed  be  be
     placed  centrally  inside  the  outer  conductor. The spaced
     between the two conductors is filled with  a  dielectric  of
     relative permittivity Er

     The bitmaps produced by <B>create_bmp_for_rect_cen_in_rect</B>  are
     24-bit bit colour bitmaps, as required by <B>atlc</B>.

     The permittivity of the bitmap, set by 'Er',  determine  the
     colours  in  the  bitmap. If Er is 1.0, 2.1, 2.2, 2.33, 2.5,
     3.3, 3.335, 4.8 or 10.2, then the  colour  corresponding  to
     that  permittivity  will  be  set  according  to the colours
     defined in COLOURS below. If Er is not one of those  permit-
     tivities,  the  region of permittivity Er will be set to the
     colour 0xCAFF00. The program <B>atlc</B> does not know  what  these
     permittivites  are,  so  they  <B>atlc</B>,  must  be told with the
     comand line option -d, as in example 4 below.


</PRE>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
     <B>-b</B> <B>bitmapsize</B>
     is used to set the size of the bitmap, and so  the  accuracy
     to  which  atlc is able to calculate the transmission line's
     properties. The default value for 'bitmapsize'  is  normally
     4,  although  this  is set at compile time. The value can be
     set anywhere from 1 to 15, but more than 8 is  probably  not
     sensible.

     <B>-f</B> <B>outfile</B>
     Set the output filename. By default, the bitmap is  sent  to
     stdout,  but  it *must* be sent to a file, with this option,
     or as described above.

     <B>-v</B>
     Causes <B>create_bmp_for_rect_cen_in_rect</B> to print some data to
     stdout.



</PRE>
<H2>COLOURS</H2><PRE>
     The 24-bit bitmaps that <B>atlc</B> expects, have 8  bits  assigned
     to  represent the amount of red, 8 for blue and 8 for green.
     Hence there are 256 levels of red, green and blue, making  a
     total of 256*256*256=16777216 colours. Every one of the pos-
     sible 16777216 colours can be defined precisely by the stat-
     ing the exact amount of red, green and blue, as in:
     red         = 255,000,000 or 0xff0000
     green       = 000,255,000 or 0x00ff00
     blue        = 000,000,255 or 0x0000ff
     black       = 000,000,000 or 0x000000
     white       = 255,255,255 or 0xffffff
     Brown       = 255,000,255 or 0xff00ff
     gray        = 142,142,142 or 0x8e8e8e

     Some colours, such as pink, turquoise,  sandy,  brown,  gray
     etc  may mean slightly different things to different people.
     This is not so with <B>atlc</B>, as the program expects the colours
     below  to  be EXACTLY defined as given. Whether you feel the
     colour is sandy or yellow is up to you, but if you use it in
     your  bitmap, then it either needs to be a colour recognised
     by atlc, <B>or</B> you must define it with a  command  line  option
     (see OPTIONS and example 5 below).
     The following conductors are recognised by atlc:
     red    = 255,000,000 or 0xff0000 is the live conductor.
     green  = 000,255,000 or 0x00ff00 is the grounded conductor.
     blue   = 000,000,000 or 0x000000 is the negative conductor

     All bitmaps <B>must</B> have the live (red)  and  grounded  (green)
     conductor.  The  blue  conductor is not currently supported,
     but it will be used to indicate a negative conductor,  which
     will  be needed if/when the program gets extended to analyse
     directional couplers.

     The following dielectrics are recognised by atlc <B>and</B> <B>so</B>  <B>are</B>
     <B>produced</B> <B>by</B> create_bmp_for_rect_cen_in_rect<B>.</B>

     white      255,255,255 or 0xFFFFFF as Er=1.0   (vacuum)
     pink       255,202,202 or 0xFFCACA as Er=1.0006 (air)
     light blue 130,052,255 or 0x8235Ef as Er=2.1   (PTFE)
     Mid gray   142,242,142 or 0x8E8E8E as Er=2.2   (duroid 5880)
     mauve         255.000,255    or    0xFF00FF    as    Er=2.33
     (polyethylene)  yellow     255,255,000 or 0xFFFF00 as Er=2.5
     (polystyrene)
     sandy      239,203,027 or 0xEFCC1A as Er=3.3   (PVC)
     brown      188,127,096 or 0xBC7F60 as Er=3.335 (epoxy resin)
     Turquoise  026,239,179 or 0x1AEFB3 as Er=4.8   (glass PCB)
     Dark gray  142,142,142 or ox696969 as Er=6.15  (duroid 6006)
     L. gray    240,240,240 or 0xDCDCDC as Er=10.2  (duroid 6010)
     D. orange  213,130,067 or 0xD5A04D as Er=100.0  (mainly  for
     test purposes)
     If the permittivity is one not in the above list, then those
     parts of the image with Er will be set to 0xCAFF00.

<H2>EXAMPLES</H2><PRE>
     Here   are    a    few    examples    of    the    use    of
     <B>create_bmp_for_rect_cen_in_rect</B>.  Again,  see the html docu-
     mentation in  atlc-X.Y.Z/docs/html-doc/index.html  for  more
     examples.
     1) In the first example, there is just a vacuum  dielectric,
     so  Er=1.0.   The  inner of 1x1 inches (or mm, miles etc) is
     placed centrally in an  outer  with  dimensions  3.3  x  3.9
     inches.

     <B>%</B> <B>create_bmp_for_rect_cen_in_rect</B> <B>3.3</B> <B>3.9</B> <B>1</B> <B>1</B> <B>1</B> <B>&gt;</B> <B>1.bmp</B>
     <B>%</B> <B>atlc</B> <B>1.bmp</B>

     2) In this second example, an inner of 15.0 mm x 5.0  mm  is
     surrounded  by  an  outer with internal dimensions of 71.5 x
     60.0 mm. There is a material with permittivity  2.1  (Er  of
     PTFE)   around   the   inner   conductor.  The  output  from
     <B>create_bmp_for_rect_cen_in_rect</B> is sent  to  a  file  2.bmp,
     which is then processed by <B>atlc</B>

     <B>%</B> <B>create_bmp_for_rect_cen_in_rect</B> <B>71.5</B> <B>60.0</B> <B>15.0</B> <B>5.0</B>  <B>2.1</B>  <B>&gt;</B>
     <B>2.bmp</B>
     <B>%</B> <B>atlc</B> <B>2.bmp</B>

     3) In example 3, the bitmap  is  made  larger,  to  increase
     accuracy,  but  otherwise  this  is  identical to the second
     example. <B>%</B> <B>create_bmp_for_rect_cen_in_rect</B> <B>-b7</B> <B>71.5</B> <B>60</B> <B>15</B>  <B>5</B>
     <B>2.1</B> <B>&gt;</B> <B>3.bmp</B>
     <B>%</B> <B>atlc</B> <B>3.bmp</B>

     In   the   fourth   example,   instead    of    re-directing
     <B>create_bmp_for_rect_cen_in_rect's</B>  output to a file with the
     &gt; sign, it is done using the -f option.
     <B>%</B> <B>create_bmp_for_rect_cen_in_rect</B> <B>-f</B> <B>4.bmp</B> <B>61.5</B>  <B>28.1</B>  <B>5</B>  <B>22</B>
     <B>2.1</B>
     <B>%</B> <B>atlc</B> <B>4.bmp</B>
