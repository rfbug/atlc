NEWS for realease 4.6.0  Nobember 2003.

This is a very different from the last release (4.5.1) in
two very important ways.

1) The basic accuracy for single dielectrics has been improved.
Now typical errors are only around 0.1%

2) I have re-enabled the calculation of multiple dielectrics
which were disabled due to accuracy concerns. I'm still not
100% happy with the algorithms, but on tests with a dual 
coaxial cable with two dielectrics shows errors of under 2%, 
I hope to improve this further at a later date.
