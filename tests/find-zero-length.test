# This test checks for the existance of a file in the source 
# tree with a length of zero bytes. This is considered an
# error, as no such file should exist. 

# Use find to search for a file of zero bytes, putting
# any such files in $top_builddir/tmp/atlc-zero-bytes

mkdir $top_builddir/tmp 2> /dev/null
rm -f $top_builddir/tmp/atlc-zero-bytes

# since tmp/atlc-zero-bytes will be found, that must be ignored.
find $top_srcdir -type f -size 0c -print | grep -v tmp/atlc-zero-bytes > $top_builddir/tmp/atlc-zero-bytes

# The file $top_builddir/tmp/atlc-zero-bytes contains a list of all the 
# files which are zero bytes. Hopefully there are none, in
# which case $top_builddir/tmp/atlc-zero-bytes will itself be zero bytes
# long. We check for that and if not fail the test. If it fails,
# the list of zero byte files are in $top_builddir/tmp/atlc-zero-bytes
# If the test passes, the empty file $top_builddir/tmp/atlc-zero-bytes
# passes.
