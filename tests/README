This is a set of tests that check the integrety of the atlc
package. Tests are performed in various ways.

1) The checksums of some supplied files are checked. 
2) The checksums of some bitmap files generated by programs
in 'atlc' are compared to those expected. 
3) The length of some binary files is checked - no checksums
are tested for binary files, as it would be pointless. 
4) The results from some calculations with atlc are compared
to those expected. 

The checksum of the files checked is compared to what is known to be 
the correct checksum using a program 'mymd5sum' which is an md5 checksum
program. I decided to distribute this, since it's not on all systems and
when it is it is known as different names. The output format differs too

6m-create_400ohm_1551Pixel_high_symmetrical_stripline.test is included
but is not run, as it take too much ram and will fail on systems with
