# This is one of a set of test that generate checksums after files are
# created, in this case the program design_coupler is run and its 
# output compared to what is expected. Since design_coupler creates
# a text file, the format of which is different between UNIX  (where
# a carriage return is used at the end of a line) and Windoze, where both
# a carriage return and a line feed are needed, the checksum of the file
# will be different on the two systems. Hence any of two checksums are 
# acceptable. 

# The GNU scientific library is needed to use design_coupler, so if it's
# not present, this test gets skipped.
