# This is one of a set of test that generate checksums after files are
# created. Generally a bitmap if first produced by a program such as sym_strip, 
# rect_in_rect, rect_cen_in_rect, circ_in_circ, circ_in_rect, 
# generate_coupler_bitmap etc.

# In a few cases, the checksum is performed on a file that is 
# supplied with the package, rather than one that is 
# generated. 

# The checksum of the bitmaps generated is compared to what is known to be 
# the correct checksum using a program 'mymd5sum' which is a cut-down version of
# the normal md5 or md5sum command.  It does not print the filename 
# to stdout, as the normal version does. 

# I have tried to test these checksums on as many systems as possible and 
# know all tests pass on all systems I have checked this on. Typically the
# systems have been mainly Suns, but running various operating systems. 
# such as Solaris 9, NetBSD, Solaris 2.5, Linux but also a PC running
# rehat Linux and a Dec Alpha. Any failure probably indicates a 
# program bug, so PLEASE PLEASE let me know about it!!
