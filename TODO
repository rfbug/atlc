TODO List

Here is a list of the ways I would like to expand atlc, in a rough order 
of time. 
  1 Re-enable support for multiple processors. 

  2 Improve accuraracy on transmission lines where there is more
    than one dielectric - e.g air and PTFE sbustrate board. The
    current code works, but some improvements could be made. 

  3.Determine the processor type a bit more senisbly in the 
    benchmark called by 'make check'. At present this is likely
    to return unknown' or a meaningless number on most platforms.
    It works pretty well on Solaris, Tru64 and HP-UX, but does
    not on all systems. 

  4.Implement a better way of enabling a user to change the 
    contrast/brightness in an image. Current, this can
    only be done with the '-f option to atlc, but this 
    requires a re-run of atlc to do this, which is hardly
    very useful, given atlc is so CPU intensive. There are 
    faster ways of doing this, just from the binary files
    (example.E.bin, example.Ex.bin, example.Ey.bin, example.U.bin, 
    example.V.bin and example.Er.bin)..


   5.Get the program 'generate_bmp_for_rect_in_circ' working.

   6 Get a decent GUI. 

If anyone has any suggestions for how to improve atlc, please email me.
