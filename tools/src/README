A collection of useful programs.

*mymd5sum*
Prints just the md5sum of a file - nothing fancy
It can't read from stdin, don't print length etc. Just
the md5 checksum.

*myfilelength*
Prints the file length of its one argument in bytes.

*locatediff*
Shows the differneces between two binary files. Useful
if a bitmap shows differing results on two differnt
macines. This makes it possible to see if its an odd
pixel, or a major problem. 

*coax* computers the impedance of a coaxial or 
ecentric coaxial structure. 

*dualcoax* computes the impedance of a coaxial line
with two concentric dielectrics.
